These are desired functionality for an environment without kernel debuginfo.

- A file descriptor to pathname routine, without needing kernel debuginfo. Eg, the paths from /proc/PID/fd/*.
- kernel.function() probes, without needing kernel debuginfo. See https://github.com/brendangregg/perf-tools/blob/master/examples/kprobe_example.txt, for an example of what I'd like to do, and note that that example, using ftrace/kprobe, works currently without kernel debuginfo.
